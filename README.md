# Project Timoneiro: Founding Document

## Mission Statement

*To develop a safe, modular, and easy-to-use drone flight software framework in Rust that empowers developers and researchers to build reliable, high-performance unmanned aerial systems with integrated onboard AI capabilities.*

## Vision

We envision a future where drone software is robust, efficient, and intelligent. By leveraging Rust’s safety guarantees alongside modern AI platforms like the Jetson Nano, our framework will:

- **Set New Standards:** Establish best practices for safety, modularity, and onboard AI integration in drone control software.
- **Accelerate Innovation:** Lower the barrier to entry for developers with clear, well-documented APIs that include AI-driven features.
- **Foster Collaboration:** Cultivate an open-source ecosystem where improvements in flight control and AI can be shared and expanded upon.

## Core Values

- **Safety First:**  
  Leverage Rust’s type system and error-handling capabilities to enforce memory safety and robust fault tolerance across all modules, including AI integrations.

- **Modularity:**  
  Architect a framework with well-defined, interchangeable components to support sensor fusion, flight control, AI processing, and communication. Each module is designed to be developed, tested, and upgraded independently.

- **Ease of Use:**  
  Provide intuitive APIs and comprehensive documentation that simplify the development of flight control algorithms and the integration of onboard AI functions.

- **Intelligent Autonomy:**  
  Integrate onboard AI to enable advanced decision-making, computer vision, and sensor analysis, ensuring the system can adapt in real time to dynamic environments.

- **Community Engagement:**  
  Build a collaborative ecosystem that encourages contributions, shared expertise, and iterative improvements across both flight control and AI functionalities.

## Project Objectives

- **Develop Core Modules:**
  - **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):**  
    Interface seamlessly with sensors, actuators, and AI hardware (e.g., Jetson Nano).
    
  - **Flight Control Module:**  
    Implement essential control loops (e.g., PID controllers) with real-time performance guarantees.
    
  - **Navigation Module:**  
    Integrate path planning, state estimation, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.
    
  - **Communication Module:**  
    Establish robust communication with ground control systems and AI components using protocols such as MAVLink.
    
  - **Onboard AI Module:**
    - **Integration:**  
      Create interfaces and data pipelines for AI processing, including computer vision and sensor fusion.
    - **Optimization:**  
      Leverage GPU acceleration on platforms like the Jetson Nano for real-time data analytics and decision-making.
    - **Flexibility:**  
      Support common AI frameworks and libraries while ensuring safe integration with the overall control loop.

- **Ensure Safety and Fault Tolerance:**  
  Utilize Rust’s compile-time checks to minimize runtime errors and design fallback strategies with robust error handling, especially for critical modules interfacing with AI systems.

- **Create a Developer-Friendly Environment:**  
  Build clear, modular APIs that abstract complex interactions between flight control and AI processing. Provide thorough documentation, sample projects, and tutorials to onboard developers and researchers.

- **Iterate and Validate:**  
  Employ simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing—including AI simulation scenarios—to validate system performance. Utilize continuous integration and comprehensive testing at every development stage.

## Scope and Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning and Prototyping
- **Requirements Gathering:**  
  Identify and document core functionalities, including baseline flight control and onboard AI needs.
  
- **Prototype Development:**  
  Build a proof-of-concept module (e.g., a basic flight control loop) and an initial AI integration prototype (e.g., simple object detection).

### Phase 2: Core Module Development
- **Hardware Abstraction and Control:**  
  Develop the HAL with drivers for sensors, actuators, and AI hardware interfaces.
  
- **Onboard AI Integration:**  
  Create a dedicated module for AI processing and build data pipelines to feed sensor data to AI algorithms and return processed insights to the flight control logic.
  
- **API and Documentation:**  
  Define clear interfaces for integrating AI modules alongside traditional flight control components.

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- **Module Integration:**  
  Combine individual components (flight control, navigation, communication, and onboard AI) ensuring seamless data flow.
  
- **Simulation & HIL Testing:**  
  Validate system behavior in both simulated and real-world environments, including diverse AI processing scenarios.

### Phase 4: Community Engagement and Iteration
- **Open-Source Release:**  
  Host the project on a public repository and actively invite contributions. This includes writing a CONTRIBUTING.md
  
- **Feedback and Iteration:**  
  Use community feedback to refine and expand the framework, with particular focus on AI performance and safety integration.

## Next Steps

- **Draft Detailed Specifications:**  
  Expand this document with technical requirements, architectural diagrams, and AI data flow charts.
  
- **Set Up Development Environment:**  
  Prepare your Rust toolchain, configure cross-compilation for target hardware, and establish simulation tools that support AI testing.
  
- **Begin Prototyping:**  
  Start with one core module (e.g., the basic flight control loop) and then prototype AI integration by processing sensor data for real-time insights.

## Reflective Questions

- How can you ensure that integrating onboard AI does not compromise the real-time safety and control of the drone?
- What strategies will you use to validate that the modular AI component performs reliably under diverse flight conditions?
- How can the API be designed to simplify future integration and updates of AI functionalities as technology evolves?
